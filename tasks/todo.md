# AgentStart 0.1.0 handoff completion

- [x] Read `HANDOFF.md`, repository instructions, and current git state.
- [x] Confirm the handoff commit is already on `origin/main` and the worktree starts clean.
- [x] Re-run the repository gate, extension Web Store packaging, mobile check, and diff check.
- [x] Audit the committed candidate for secrets, private keys/certificates/tokens, personal paths,
      oversized or generated build artifacts, forbidden test/smoke/E2E assets, suppressions, and
      active legacy branding.
- [x] Inspect the complete committed diff and verify release workflow/ref behavior and remote
      GitHub Actions state after the push.
- [ ] Fix the in-scope CI defects, push the follow-up, and confirm its remote checks are green.
- [x] Record final evidence and distinguish completed repository work from unperformed external
      publishing steps.

## Review

- The handoff commit was already `ba8986e83453d98f0ffe5e5cac4e1a4dedee132d` on `origin/main`.
  Its Extension Package run passed; Daemon Native Builds and Mobile Checks exposed the remaining
  cross-platform compiler failures.
- The daemon fixes narrow macOS-only imports, variants, and logic with target conditions, preserve
  the Windows executable path as an `OsString`, and retain the existing platform behavior.
- The mobile fixes avoid an `inout self` concurrency capture, make six protocol conformances
  explicitly nonisolated, and split one compiler-heavy aggregation expression without changing its
  result.
- `pnpm check`, `vp run agentstart-mobile#check`, and an Xcode 26.6 simulator build all pass.
- The Web Store archive contains 949 files, has SHA-256
  `24e257e15fcbb4a844322d46d41b889384812c232761e3c6e482cf19c62d267e`, and contains no source maps,
  source/test directories, `browser_settings`, or `update_url`.
- Diff, secret/private-key, personal-path, tracked-artifact, forbidden test-path, suppression, and
  Rust panic/unsafe scans are clean. The two secret-pattern matches are the literal public setting
  name `sk-notification-settings`, not credentials.
- No tags, GitHub releases, npm packages, Chrome Web Store submissions, TestFlight uploads, or
  notarization actions were created. External publishing remains intentionally unperformed; the
  missing npm/PostHog and Chrome Web Store secrets remain operator-owned blockers.
- Final remote Daemon Native Builds and Mobile Checks will be recorded after the follow-up push.
